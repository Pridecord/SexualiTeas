## Identities v2.x (this repo) will not be receiving any future updates.
I'm currently rewriting the plugin over at [lucyydotp/identities3](https://github.com/lucyydotp/identities3). Please direct any feedback you may have there.
Support will be offered for the mean time on [Discord](https://discord.lucypoulton.net).

**Identities** is a plugin aimed at LGBTQ+-friendly servers allowing players to set their identities properly. No more faffing with permission groups, no more nicknaming, no more worrying about people with less common identity sets!

- Players can **set their identities** individually
- Players can set **multiple identity sets**
- PlaceholderAPI support - **automatically conjugate** verbs and write **identity-aware automated messages**
- Custom **player-defined** identity sets
- **MySQL support** for BungeeCord servers
- It's **really pretty** and supports RGB throughout
- Configurable **regex-based filter** to prevent abuse
- Available for **Bukkit** and **BungeeCord** (more platforms coming soon!)
